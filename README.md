# Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Scientists  
**CMU 38-616 / 09-616 – Spring 2026**

This repository accompanies the course *Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Scientists*, which focuses on applying modern machine learning and deep learning methods to real-world scientific problems.

## Course Overview
The course is designed for STEM graduate students and advanced undergraduates with prior programming experience. It emphasizes practical understanding over theory-heavy derivations, with a strong focus on building, training, evaluating, and interpreting neural network models.

Students learn how to use deep learning as a scientific tool, integrating data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation into a single workflow.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Use Python, Jupyter notebooks, and PyTorch for machine learning workflows
- Explore, visualize, and preprocess large scientific datasets
- Build and train neural networks for classification, regression, and representation learning
- Understand and apply core concepts such as overfitting, regularization, and model selection
- Implement end-to-end deep learning pipelines for scientific applications
- Critically analyze model performance, limitations, and interpretability
